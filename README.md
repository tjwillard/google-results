Starting to make the Google results page.  I got pretty comfortable with Flexbox when making the homepage, but I would like to try out the grid layout on this page (if appropriate) and see if I can incorporate flexbox into it.

I've started on it and feel that flexbox would work best on its own for the majority of the page.  Considering practicing grid to make the bottom portion with "Related searches"
